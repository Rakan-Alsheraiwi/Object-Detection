Object Detection
Project Overview
This project focuses on Object Detection using YOLOv5. It detects objects in both images and videos, drawing bounding boxes around detected objects and providing object counts. The project integrates a multilingual translation pipeline, translating the detected object labels from English to Arabic, supporting Arabic-speaking users. The solution is built using Python and libraries like Torch, OpenCV, PIL, Gradio, Pandas, and Hugging Face Transformers.
